Thanks to Brad Bazemore ([sonyccd](https://github.com/sonyccd)) for developing the original driver.

This is a ROS1/ROS2 driver for the RoboClaw motor controllers made by [Basicmicro Motion Control](https://www.basicmicro.com). It is actively maintained by the [Northern Robotics Laboratory](http://norlab.ulaval.ca/) of UniversitÃ© Laval.

## Dependencies

This ROS driver is using the python driver developed by [Team Chat Robotique](https://gitlab.com/team-chat-robotique/libraries/team-chat-robotique-roboclaw-python) (Thanks!). Install it with pip :

```sh
pip install tcr-roboclaw
```


## Before you begin

For the ROS1 (`melodic`) version : [melodic](https://github.com/norlab-ulaval/roboclaw_ros/tree/melodic)

Before you use this package, you need to calibrate the velocity PID on the RoboClaw. This will require to use BasicMicro's [Motion Studio](https://www.basicmicro.com/downloads) software (only available for Windows).

From the RoboClaw [user manual](https://downloads.basicmicro.com/docs/roboclaw_user_manual.pdf):

> Motion Studio provides the option to auto tune velocity and position control. To use the auto tune option, make sure the encoder and motor are running in the desired direction and the basic PWM control of the motor works as expected. It is recommend to ensure the motor and encoder
combination are functioning properly before using the auto tune feature.

> Go to the PWM Settings screen in Motion Studio.
> Slide the motor slider up to start moving the motor forward. Check the encoder is increasing in value. If it is not either reverse the motor wires or the encoder wires. The recheck.
> To start auto tune click the auto tune button for the motor channel that is will be tuned first. The auto tune function will try to determine the best settings for that motor channel.

## Usage instructions

Just clone the repo into your colcon workspace.  Remember to make sure ROS2 has permissions to use the dev port you give it.

```sh
cd <workspace>/src
git clone https://github.com/norlab-ulaval/roboclaw_ros.git
cd <workspace>
colcon build --symlink-install --packages-select roboclaw_ros
. install/local_setup.bash
ros2 launch roboclaw_ros roboclaw_node.launch.py
```

## Parameters

The launch file can be configured at the command line with arguments, by changing the value in the launch file or through the `ros2 param` server.
